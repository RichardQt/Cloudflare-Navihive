# Task Description
'src/' (see below for folder content)  每次添加卡片或者群组的时候都要刷新一次，请帮我修改成增量更新

# Project Overview
The project is a navigation site application built with React (TypeScript) and Material UI. It allows users to organize links (sites) into groups. Data is fetched from an API. The current issue is that adding new groups or sites triggers a full data refresh, leading to a less smooth user experience. The goal is to implement incremental updates for these actions.

# Analysis (Populated by RESEARCH mode)
- **File Analyzed**: [`src/App.tsx`](src/App.tsx)
- **Functions of Interest**:
    - `handleCreateGroup` (lines 569-584): Creates a new group. Currently calls `fetchData()` on success.
    - `handleCreateSite` (lines 617-631): Creates a new site. Currently calls `fetchData()` on success.
    - `fetchData` (lines 398-431): Fetches all groups and their associated sites, then updates the `groups` state, causing a full re-render.
- **State Variable**: `groups` (type `GroupWithSites[]`) stores the main data for rendering.
- **Current Update Mechanism**: After creating a group or site via API calls (`api.createGroup`, `api.createSite`), the `fetchData()` function is invoked. This function retrieves all groups and sites from the backend, replacing the entire `groups` state. This causes a full refresh of the displayed content.
- **Requirement for Incremental Update**: To avoid a full refresh, the local `groups` state must be updated directly with the newly created group or site information. This requires the API creation methods (`api.createGroup`, `api.createSite`) to return the newly created entity, including its server-assigned ID and other relevant fields. If they don't, modifications to the API client methods or backend API responses will be necessary.
- **Observation**: The functions `handleSiteUpdate`, `handleSiteDelete`, `handleGroupUpdate`, `handleGroupDelete` also call `fetchData()`. While the user specifically mentioned adding cards/groups, these other functions might also benefit from incremental updates, but the current request focuses on creation.
